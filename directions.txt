Requirements
Implement a basic authentication middleware to use for protecting endpoints.
The GET /api/things endpoint should remain public.
The GET /api/things/:thing_id endpoint should be protected by basic auth.
The GET /api/things/:thing_id/reviews endpoint should be protected by basic auth.
The POST /api/reviews endpoint should be protected by basic auth and automatically assign a user_id.
The thingful-client should store the base64 encoded credentials when the login form is submitted.
The base64 encoded credentials should be sent in requests to protected endpoints.
If a user attempts to view the login form when they're already logged in, they should be redirected to the thing list page.
If a user tries to view reviews for a thing, they should be redirected to the login form page.
